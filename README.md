# 🌍 TravKit

**TravKit** is a universal travel checklist app that helps you remember all the essential items and tasks you need for your trips.
No more stressing over what to pack or forgetting important things — TravKit comes with pre-built checklist templates categorized for convenience.

## 🔐 Authentication (How It Works)

TravKit uses **passwordless authentication with Email Magic Links** provided by **Supabase Auth**.

1. Users enter their email address
2. A secure magic link is sent to their inbox
3. Clicking the link instantly signs them in
4. No passwords are stored or managed by the user

### Why Magic Links?

* 🔒 More secure than traditional passwords
* ⚡ Faster and frictionless login experience
* 🧠 No password resets or credential management
* 🛡 Reduced risk of phishing and credential leaks
